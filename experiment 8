Linux Package Management Using RPM and YUM 
Package Management in Linux
A package is a compressed archive containing:
• Software binaries
• Configuration files
• Metadata (version, dependencies, scripts)
Package managers simplify software management by automating:
• Installation
• Upgrade
• Removal
• Dependency handling
RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)
rpm is a low-level package manager used in Red Hat–based distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora).
Key features:
• Install packages
• Query package information
• Verify package integrity
• Remove packages
YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified)
yum is a high-level package manager that works on top of RPM and automatically resolves
dependencies by fetching packages from repositories.
System vs. Language Managers
• System Managers (APT/YUM): Manage the Operating System and shared utilities.
• Language Managers (NPM/Pip): Manage libraries for a specific programming language
(e.g., JavaScript/Node.js). They usually reside "on top" of the system manager.
DPKG (Debian Package)
dpkg is the low-level package manager for Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu). It is
used to install, remove, and provide information about .deb packages but does not
automatically download dependencies.
APT (Advanced Package Tool)
apt is the high-level package manager that works on top of dpkg. It handles the retrieval
of packages from remote repositories and automatically resolves complex dependencies.
